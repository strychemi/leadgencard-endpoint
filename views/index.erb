    <h4>Welcome to the Lead Gen Card endpoint sample.</h4>
    <p>This is a basic demo of an endpoint accepting leads from Twitter <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170389" target="_blank">Lead Generation Cards</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Now that you have the server running, there are a number of things you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test your own server.
<li>Create a Lead Gen Card via the UI.
<li>Create a Lead Gen Card via the API.
</ul>

<p>To help you better understand the overall flow, we have a <a href="https://twitter.com/jaakkosf/status/486012969273139201">public tweet + Card</a>
you can use to submit a lead. (You'll have to be logged into Twitter.com first.) </p>
<p>Once you have submitted your information, you can then visit
<a href="https://limitless-ocean-4365.herokuapp.com/card/176b">our example test server</a> and enter Card id <strong>176b</strong> to
confirm your lead information was sent from Twitter to the example test server.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="test">

<div>
	<br>
	<h4>Test your server's lead capture endpoint </h4>
</div>
<p>Click on <a href="https://<%= request.host %>:<%= request.port %>/endpoint?name=Ryan+Choi&screen_name=rchoi&tw_userId=12345612&email=test@test.com&token=SOME_TOKEN&card=12345" target="_blank">this link</a>, which submits a lead capture to your server via a GET request. You should confirm you get an `OK` response.</p>
<p>If you look at the URL, you will see it expects the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/ads/reference/get/accounts/%3Aaccount_id/cards/lead_gen" target="_blank">default parameters</a> below:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>name</i>
<li><i>screen_name</i>
<li><i>tw_userId</i>
<li><i>email</i>
<li><i>token</i>
<li><i>card</i>
</ul>
<p>Then come back here and enter the card id <strong>12345</strong> below.</p>

	<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>After you create a Lead Gen Card with a <code>submit_url</code>, newly captured leads on Twitter will be sent to
your server via the URL and either GET or POST payload that contains the following parameters (formatted in JSON for readability):
</p>

<pre>
{
  "name": "Ryan Choi",
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "screen_name": "rchoi",
  "tw_userId": 54256387,
  "card": "16po2",
  "token": "SOME_TOKEN"
}
</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="card">

<div>
	<h4>Create a Card: Via the UI</h4>
</div>
<p>To create a Card via the UI, visit <a href="https://ads.twitter.com" target="_blank">https://ads.twitter.com</a> and click on the "Creatives" link at the top. You will then see the below
screen that will walk you through creating a Lead Gen Card. Be sure to populate the <code>Submit URL</code> as <strong>https://<%= request.host %>/endpoint</strong> for Twitter to submit leads to your server.</p>
<p>Lastly, ensure that you  tweet the resulting Card URL for your first Lead Gen Card in a tweet.</p>

<div>
	<h4>Create a Card: Via the API</h4>
</div>
<p>Below is a <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twurl" target="_blank">twurl</a> example to create a Lead Gen Card:</p>
<pre>
twurl -H ads-api.twitter.com -X POST -d "account_id=MY_ACCOUNT_ID&name=Lead Gen Card Test&image_media_id=MY_MEDIA_ID&title=Test Title&cta=Submit Now&fallback_url=http://dev.twitter.com&privacy_policy_url=http://dev.twitter.com&submit_method=POST&submit_url=https://<%= request.host %>/endpoint" "/0/accounts/MY_ACCOUNT_ID/cards/lead_gen"
</pre>
<p>Two things to note in the twurl example above:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <i>MY_ACCOUNT_ID</i>, use the 5-character string in the URL after logging into ads.twitter.com.
<li>For <i>MY_MEDIA_ID</i>, read how to upload media on our <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/uploading-media">Guide to Uploading Media</a>. (As a shortcut, you can tweet out an image in the UI and query back the tweet's media.id_str.)
</ul>
<p>The response you will receive will look like the following:</p>
<pre>
{"data_type":"card","data":{"name":"Lead Gen Card Test","fallback_url":"http:\/\/dev.twitter.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media-preview\/snf:666848265044799488\/47q4tEdq.jpg","privacy_policy_url":"http:\/\/dev.twitter.com","preview_url":"https:\/\/cards.twitter.com\/cards\/MY_ACCOUNT_ID\/16ppl","submit_url":"https:\/\/tranquil-shelf-2540.herokuapp.com\/endpoint","id":"16ppl","account_id":"MY_ACCOUNT_ID","cta":"Submit Now","created_at":"2015-11-18T06:49:59Z","submit_method":"POST","title":"Test Title","updated_at":"2015-11-18T06:49:59Z","deleted":false,"card_type":"LEAD_GENERATION"},"request":{"params":{"name":"Lead Gen Card Test","fallback_url":"http:\/\/dev.twitter.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media-preview\/snf:666848265044799488\/47q4tEdq.jpg","privacy_policy_url":"http:\/\/dev.twitter.com","submit_url":"https:\/\/tranquil-shelf-2540.herokuapp.com\/endpoint","account_id":"MY_ACCOUNT_ID","cta":"Submit Now","submit_method":"POST","title":"Test Title","card_type":"LEAD_GENERATION"}}}
</pre>
<p>Most importantly, the <code>preview_url</code> is the URL of the Lead Gen Card.</p>

<div>
	<h4>Tweet the Card</h4>
</div>

<p>Once you have created your Card (either through the UI or the API), you should have a resulting Card URL. You can then
tweet this URL directly, and the Card will hydrate upon view of the Card on both web and mobile. The tweet with Card will look
like the below:</p>
